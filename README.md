# Phase-1 Week 1 Toy problems.

# Project goals
$  Use Conditional statements to perform different actions based on different conditions.
$ Store a function in a  data structure.
$ Write a function that returns an output.
$ Write switch statements to perfom different actions based on different conditions. Call a function to return intended output.

# Introduction
In this toy problem, we'll take a look at how we can Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks and output correct grades as desired, write a program to detect speed taking the speed of the car as input and be able to Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. The program should calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

# Instructions
// installations
$ git clone https://github.com/evance-14/phase-1-week1-toyproblem.git.
$ $ cd ../phase-1-week1-toy problem.
$ Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks and output the correct grades as desired.
$ Write a program to detect speed taking in the speed of the car as input . f the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points
$ Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. The program should calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.
